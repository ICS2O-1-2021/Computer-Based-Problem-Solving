Preface
=============

The goal of the book is to take students from the point of never having done any formal programming and lead them first through a structured method of problem solving (Input-Process-Output and Top-Down design) and then into the early basics of Object Oriented Programming (or OOP). If this book is used to teach a high school course in computer programming, there are likely many other learning outcomes that students are required to do that are not presented in this book. The focus of this book is strictly on solving problems with computer programming.

This book will use Visual Basic and C# as the example languages. Although there are hundreds of different programming languages and many good ones that can be used to teach someone that has never programmed before, these languages have many advantages. The first and probable most important is that they are completely free. This is a huge advantage, since schools and students do not have to worry about the cost. Students can have the exact same IDE at home as they do at school, which up until now has not happened often. Although they are free, both are still first class development environments with everything a student and most professional developers would ever need.

Visual Basic is an excellent language for first time programmers. They can get visual GUIs on the screen fast, which builds confidence. It is also very “forgiving”, so that students do not get bogged down in syntax problems. C#, although not as forgiving as Visual Basic, is very close to Java and is therefore a great second language for students to learn especially if they will be doing programming after high school. In addition to these reasons, there is a huge amount of online resources for these languages, which will help students and teachers alike.

It should be remembered that the focus of this book is to teach students how to program, not to just teach them a programming language. To do this the focus is on “Problem Solving”, using a computer program as a problem solving aid. Programming languages change over time and come and go but a good foundation of programming concepts and how to solve a problem will allow anyone to get over the syntax of a new programming language.

This book does not include any instructions on how to load, use, create GUIs or any other housekeeping of the VB or C # IDE. There are many other resources that can aid both students and teachers alike for this. Many of them are available from Microsoft online.

The following are links to the programming languages as well as to the above mentioned resources that might be useful:

Within the text you will see words or groups of words that are hyperlinked (blue text and underlined). If the full URL is included, then type that into your web browser to see the page. If the link directs you to the Wikipedia webpage (http://en.wikipedia.org) for a topic, then just the word that is underlined and you can place that word in the previous URL to find it definition. The point of linking to Wikipedia is to give additional information about a topic if the reader is unsure about the concept. Please note that I do not have control over what is placed on the Wikipedia webpages and although it seemed useful and correct when I looked at the link, these pages are changing all the time. Despite this, the information is usually correct and can be very helpful.

When coding examples are included, they are colour coded so that they can be easily distinguished. VB code is in light blue and C# is in light green. There are also two tables of contents for code examples so that you can easily find what you are looking for, in the appropriate language. The coding examples are usually just snippets and do not include the complete source code you would need to recreate the program. Also as mentioned above, there is none or very little reference to the underlying GUI that exists in the program.

Key words and concepts that are being described are placed on the left-hand side of the page in the margin in blue. These are the words that you will see in the index and there so that they are easily referenced when looking up some topic.
