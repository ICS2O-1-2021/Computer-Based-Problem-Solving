Top Down Design
=================

`Top-down<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top-down_and_bottom-up_design>`_ design is a method of breaking a problem down into smaller, less complex pieces from the initial overall problem. Most “good” problems are too complex to solve in just one step, so we divide the problem up into manageable pieces, solve each one of them and then bring everything back together again. The process of making the steps more and more specific in top-down design is called stepwise refinement.
