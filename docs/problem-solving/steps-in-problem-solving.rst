Steps in Problem Solving
========================

There are many ways to solve a problem but having a process to follow can help make problem solving easier. If you do not think through a problem logically, then you end up just going around in circles and never solving it. The following is just one of many `Six Step Problem Solving Systems <https://www.google.com/search?q=six+step+problem+solving+system>`_, which can be used to solve any type of problem, not just ones that will be solved on a computer. The good thing is that the system translates nicely to computer problems, which is very useful, since the focus of the book is to solve problems on a computer. The six steps in this system are:

1. What is the problem
2. Make a model
3. Analyze the model
4. Find the solution
5. Check the solution
6. Document the solution

##1. What is the Problem

Before you can solve a problem correctly, you have to ensure that you understand the problem thoroughly. Many times you will have to go back to the source of the problem and confirm information or ask additional questions. You might have to have them restate the problem so that it is very clear what they are asking.

Here are things to remember:
* What am I trying to find?
* What do I know / don’t know?
* State the problem in your own words.
* Get them to restate the problem.

2. Make a Model
===============
Making a model of a problem is a great way to see what is really going on and to lead you to a solution. It can show you patterns or you might recognize the problem from before. The model might be a drawing, picture, chart, a physical 3D scale model, or something else. Most “good” problems are too complex to be solved simply, they need to be broken down into smaller pieces, solve each of the smaller pieces and then bring all the small solutions back together to solve the original problem. 

Here are things to remember:
* Draw or create a model.
* Break the problem down into pieces.
* Is there a pattern?
