Example Problems
================

Here are some examples of problems and a possible solution using the six step method. Note that these problems are not necessarily problems that you would use a computer to help you solve. Latter on these six steps will be translated into six step used to solve problems that a computer program will be used to help solve.

1. Folding Paper
----------------

**How small can a piece of paper be made?**  

1. What is the problem?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The wording in the problem is a little vague and could be confusing. What is meant by “made”? Is it cutting, burning, shredding or cutting? You should go back to the source of the question to find out. You might find out that the real question is, “How many times can a piece of paper be folded?”

2. Make a model.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
For this problem our model will just be our actual physical piece of paper. It is not always possible to make a model using that “real” item. What would happen if the question was to fold paper made of gold, can you afford gold leaf paper? You might have to use a suitable substitute.

2. The Salmon Swimming
