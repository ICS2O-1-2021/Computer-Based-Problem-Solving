Up to this point, every time we saved a piece of information (a number, string, an object â€¦) into a variable, it has always been a single piece of information and we have saved it into one single variable. This makes good sense for many things but sometimes it is very inconvenient. If I asked you to save the final mark for every student in this class, we would have to create a variable for every student in this class to hold their mark. Recreating these variables over and over again, should be the clue that there is a better way of doing this. Another problem is the program would only be useful for a class that had that exact same number of students, not very likely to occur often. To save information like this we should be using an `array <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Array_data_structure>`_.
