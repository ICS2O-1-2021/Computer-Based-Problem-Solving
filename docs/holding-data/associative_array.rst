Associative Array
=================

A associative array, dictionary, map, or symbol table all refer to the same thing, usually, in computer science. It is an abstract data type composed of a collection of key and value pairs, such that each possible key appears at most once in the collection. The key and value can usually be of almost any type, although usually the key is represented by a string. (If it was an integer, then you would just have an array!). The data type usually comes with operators like, the addition of a pair to the collection, the removal of a pair from the collection, the modification of an existing pair, the lookup of a value associated with a particular key.
