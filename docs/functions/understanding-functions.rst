Understanding Functions
=======================

A `Subroutine <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subroutine>`_ or what we will just refer to as a function is a block of code written to perform a specific task. We have actually been using functions all along our programming journey so far and you probably have not even notices. Many functions are built into most programming languages, like print for example. In python we have been placing our code in main(), which is a function. You can also create functions to do specific calculations, like converting temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit and Kelvin for example. This type of conversion is very common and we might want to use it in another program (re-usability is very important in programming. Why re-invent the wheel, just use someone else's code).
