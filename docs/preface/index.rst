Preface

This book will use several programming languages in the examples. Although there are hundreds of different programming languages and many good ones that can be used to teach someone that has never programmed before, these languages have many advantages. The first and probable most important is that they are completely free. This is a huge advantage, since schools and students do not have to worry about the cost. Students can have the exact same IDE at home as they do at school, which up until now has not happened often. Although they are free, both are still first class development environments with everything a student and most professional developers would ever need.

It should be remembered that the focus of this book is to teach students how to program, not to just teach them a programming language. To do this the focus is on “Problem Solving”, using a computer program as a problem solving aid. Programming languages change over time and come and go but a good foundation of programming concepts and how to solve a problem will allow anyone to get over the syntax of a new programming language.

This book does not include any instructions on how to load, use, create GUIs or any other housekeeping of any particular language. There are many other resources that can aid both students and teachers alike for this. 

Within the text you will see words or groups of words that are hyperlinked (blue text and underlined). If the full URL is included, then type that into your web browser to see the page. If the link directs you to the Wikipedia webpage (http://en.wikipedia.org) for a topic, then just the word that is underlined and you can place that word in the previous URL to find it definition. The point of linking to Wikipedia is to give additional information about a topic if the reader is unsure about the concept. Please note that I do not have control over what is placed on the Wikipedia webpages and although it seemed useful and correct when I looked at the link, these pages are changing all the time. Despite this, the information is usually correct and can be very helpful.

Key words and concepts that are being described are placed on the left-hand side of the page in the margin in blue. These are the words that you will see in the index and there so that they are easily referenced when looking up some topic.
