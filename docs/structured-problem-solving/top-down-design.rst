Top Down Design in Programming
==============================

As we have seen above, top-down design is a process of breaking a complicated problem down into simpler steps that actually can be solved. In programming one of the easiest models to follow for beginner programmers is the “Input-Process-Output” model. You are most likely already familiar with this model, even if you do not realize you are using it. In life there are many examples of getting information, doing something with it and then returning the result. The most common example is probable the problems you do in math class every day. You get information, do calculations and then return the answer. We are going to use this model to help us solve our computer problems. The first step in our top-down design will always be to break the problem up into input-process-output.
